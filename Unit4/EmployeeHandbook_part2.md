## 2. Employment Policies
### 2.1 Equal Employment Opportunity
TechCorp Solutions is an Equal Opportunity Employer committed to a diverse and inclusive workplace. We prohibit discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status, veteran status, or other protected characteristics. This applies to all employment decisions including hiring, compensation, training, promotions, and termination.

Report discrimination to your supervisor, HR, or our ethics hotline (1-800-XXX-XXXX). All complaints will be investigated. Retaliation is prohibited.

### 2.2 At-Will Employment
Employment is at-will. Either party may terminate the relationship at any time, with or without cause or notice. Only written agreements signed by the CEO or CHRO can modify this. This handbook is not a contract and policies may change without notice.

### 2.3 Employment Classifications
**Full-Time:** 40+ hours/week, eligible for all benefits
**Part-Time:** <40 hours/week, pro-rated benefits
**Temporary:** Project-based, limited duration, generally no benefits
**Exempt:** Salaried, no overtime pay
**Non-Exempt:** Hourly, eligible for overtime (1.5x after 40 hours/week)

Your classification is in your offer letter. Contact HR with questions.

### 2.4 Background Checks and Drug Testing
**Background Checks:** All final candidates undergo background checks including employment/education verification, criminal history, and other relevant checks. Conducted per FCRA guidelines. Adverse findings are individually assessed and may not automatically disqualify candidates.

**Drug Testing:** Required for safety-sensitive positions and certain client sites. May include pre-employment, random, post-accident, and reasonable suspicion testing. Conducted by certified labs. Refusal or positive results may result in offer withdrawal or termination. Drug-free workplace policy applies to all employees.
