All employees must conduct themselves professionally and ethically. Key requirements:

**Professionalism:** Treat colleagues, clients, and visitors with respect. Communicate professionally, meet commitments, and maintain a positive attitude.

**Compliance:** Follow all laws, regulations, and company policies. Record financial transactions accurately. Use company resources appropriately. Limited personal use is acceptable if it doesn't interfere with work.

**Prohibited Conduct:** Harassment, discrimination, violence, threats, theft, fraud, substance abuse, insubordination, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information are strictly prohibited and may result in termination.

**Reporting Violations:** Report concerns to your supervisor, HR, Legal, or the Ethics Hotline (1-800-XXX-XXXX, available 24/7). No retaliation for good faith reports.

### 3.2 Dress Code

**Client-facing roles** require business professional attire for meetings and presentations.

**Casual Fridays:** Jeans and company-branded casual wear permitted.

**Accommodations:** Religious, cultural, and medical dress needs will be accommodated. Contact HR to discuss.

Managers may ask employees not in compliance to change. Repeated violations may result in discipline.

### 3.3 Attendance and Punctuality

**Punctuality:** Arrive ready to work at your scheduled start time. Notify supervisor immediately if you'll be late. Occasional tardiness is understood, but excessive tardiness (3+ times/month) may result in discipline.

**Absences:** Notify supervisor before your scheduled start time if you cannot work. Submit vacation requests via HR portal with at least 2 weeks notice.

**No Call/No Show:** Failure to report for work and notify supervisor may result in disciplinary action. Three consecutive days of no call/no show is considered job abandonment.

**Breaks (Non-Exempt):** 30-60 minute unpaid meal break for 6+ hour shifts. Two 15-minute paid rest breaks per 8-hour shift.

**Attendance Issues:** Excessive absenteeism or tardiness will result in progressive discipline: verbal warning → written warning → final warning → termination. Absences for FMLA, approved leave, or company closures don't count against attendance.
